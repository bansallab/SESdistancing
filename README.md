This repository contains the code and the data used in the statistical analysis and to produce the figures of the manuscript "Socio-economic disparities in social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States".

Mobility data was obtained from Unacast (https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard). Mobility measures are derived using aggregated anonymous location information on tens of millions of mobile devices. The use of the data is fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) guidelines.

Socio-economic information was obtained separately from the American Community Survey (race, population density), the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (poverty), and the Quarterly Census on Employment and Wages for the third quarter of 2019 (for the essential workers proportion).
